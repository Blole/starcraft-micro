\section{Architecture}

In order to have a huge flexibility in our bot behaviors we designed our AI in a modular and hierarchical fashion (Figure \ref{classDiag}).


\begin{figure}[h!b]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
Commander \\
\emph{Make the overall decision} \\
\hline
\end{tabular} \ \\
\begin{tabular}{c}
$\downarrow$
\end{tabular} \ \\
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
Squad Manager \\
\emph{Handle $n$ units and lead them into battle} \\
\hline
\end{tabular} \ \\
\begin{tabular}{c}
$\downarrow$
\end{tabular} \ \\
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
Units \\
\emph{Fight for glory} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class Diagram}
\label{classDiag}
\end{figure}

Our bot also uses behaviors tree (using the library in \cite{libbehavior}). A example of the behavior tree used by the units acheiving \texttt{Kitting\footnote{Staying at a distance, using ranged attacks, and running whenever the enemy comes near}} is depicted in Figure \ref{behaAttackClos}.

Two differents behaviors has been study for our bot:
\begin{shortitem}
\item Scripted based behaviors
\item Heuristic based behaviors
\end{shortitem}

\begin{definition}[Scripted based behaviors]
Make decision only on a reactive way and do not make any plan for the future of the game.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Heuristic based behaviors]
% TODO
blabla...
\end{definition}

\section{Architecture}

In order to have a huge flexibility in our bot behaviors we designed our AI in a modular and hierarchical fashion (Figure \ref{classDiag}).
This architecture and the addition of behaviors tree was perfectly fitted for the development of multiple bots -- small part of the code has to be change to improve/change the bot behavior.
It also looks like a human hierarchy -- faciliting the conception of each bot.

    \ \\
    \begin{description}
        \item[Commander:]  One per game who make overall decision for the game such as: Creating squad, assigning objectives to squads (\texttt{Attack}, \texttt{Flee}, \texttt{Go to}, \ldots).
        \item[Squad:] As many squad as the commander want. They have a military goal and are in charge of micro-managing each units. 
        \item[Unit:] Each game unit has many attributes and some scripted behaviors (\texttt{Attack closest ennemy}, \texttt{Regroup with squad}, \texttt{Attack ennemy with kitting strategy}, \ldots)

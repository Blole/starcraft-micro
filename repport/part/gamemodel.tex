\section{Game Combat Model}

In order to execute search of a solution, we created a model based on the work of \cite{abcd}, composed of the following components:

\begin{definition}[State]
A state $s=<t,p,m,U>$ is composed of the following:
\begin{shortitem}
\item Current game time $t$
\item Player $p$ who performed action $a$ to generate $s$
\item 
\end{shortitem}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Unit]
a
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Action]
a
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Effect]
a
\end{definition}

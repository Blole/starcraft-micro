\begin{bfseries} Conclusion -- \end{bfseries}
\emph{While extremely complicated in terms of searchability, RTS games are indeed a solid platform for developing and testing multi agent coordination. Our work was focused on the micromanagement and we were able to implement both scripted and searching behaviors.}
\emph{Our most important contribution, however, is that of our general RTS game combat model, which offers substantial detail and flexibility, and can encompass most, if not all, aspects of RTS combat.}
\emph{Even if the search algorithms was not able to defeat the built-in AI, the results are encouraging. Improving move ordering and find unit group abstractions that reduce the state space may be good leads in order to improve them.}
\emph{We have to keep in mind that the ultimate goal of this line of research is to handle large combat scenarios in real time -- where scripted behaviors show their weaknesses.}

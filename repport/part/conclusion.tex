\begin{bfseries} Conclusion -- \end{bfseries}
    \emph{While extremely complicated in term of searchability, RTS game are indeed a solid platform for developing and testing multi agent cooperative behaviors. Our worked focus on micro management and so far we were able to implement some ``classic behaviors'' (\emph{i.e} behaviors used by real human player).} 
    \emph{However, in a future work we want to develop the UCT search and accomplish statistical comparison of the bots. We also aim at improving the scripted bot to fight with 3 kinds of units.}

\begin{bfseries} Conclusion -- \end{bfseries}
    \emph{While extremely complicated in term of searchability, RTS game are indeed a solid platform for developing and testing multi agent cooperative behaviors. Our work was focused on micro management and we were able to implement some ``classic behaviors'' (\emph{i.e} behaviors used by real human player).} 
    \emph{We also manage to create a model which can be used in most RTS game. The game state representation can easily be extender in order to take in account more kind of unit, more effect, etc.} 
\emph{Even if the search algorithms did not defeat the built-in AI, the results are encouraging. Improving move ordering and find unit group abstractions that reduce the state space are good lead in order to improve them.}
\emph{We have to keep in mind that the ultimate goal of this line of research is to handle large combat scenarios in real time -- where scripted behaviors shows their weaknesses.}

\section{Context}

RTS game provide a very interesting baseground for developping and testing multi-agent cooperative behavior.
Our goal was to create an AI for the \texttt{Stacraft: Broodwar} game. We focused only on the military aspect of the game. Therefore, our bot do not handle harvesting ressources, build order, troops production, \ldots.

We only dealt with the following scenario: Two teams fight against each other with the same number of units (\texttt{Terran Marine}). The goal is to destroy all ennemies units.
This restriction was made in order to test and compare different micro-management algorithm. 
At the current time, we have the following bots:
\begin{shortitem}
\item \texttt{AC: Attack Closest} All units attack their closest opponent,
\item \texttt{ACL: Attack Closest Lethal} All units attack the closest opponent that will not die soon(\emph{i.e} If the amount of damage attributed to this unit is not already enought to kill him soon),
\item \texttt{KS: Kitting Strategy} All units attack their closest opponent applying a kitting\footnote{Staying at a distance, using ranged attacks, and running whenever the enemy comes near} strategy,
\item \texttt{KSL: Kitting Strategy Lethal} All units attack the closest opponent that will not die soon applying a kitting strategy,
\item \texttt{GB: Graph Bot} Heuristic search in the game graph to compute the cleverest action.
\end{shortitem}

\begin{definition}[Scripted based behaviors]
Make decision only on a reactive way and do not make any plan for the future of the game. (Bots \texttt{AC, ACL, KS, KSL})
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Heuristic based behaviors]
% TODO
blabla...
\end{definition}

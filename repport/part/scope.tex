\section{Problem statement}
In this paper we only focus of the \textbf{\textit{micromanagement of the units of two players engaging in combat in RTS games}}.
Each player is given a number of units, the whole map is visible and the goal is to control these units so as to kill all enemy units while minimizing the losses on the own team.

The main challenging questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item Where to move the units?
    \item Which enemies to attack?
    \item How to coordinate well with team members?
    \item How to detect and exploit opponent weaknesses?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}
In this paper we only focus of the micro-management of units during combat in RTS games.
The scenario is: there are two players, each is given a number of units at different locations that are relatively close and the whole map is visible. And the goal is to destroy all enemy units, with minimal losses on the own team.
The main challenging questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
    \item How to navigate units? 
    \item How to cooperate well with team members?
    \item How to detect and exploit opponent weaknesses?
    \item How to coordinate attacks?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{bfseries} Abstract -- \end{bfseries}
\emph{
Real Time Strategy games (RTS) present a complete simulated environment that pose many interesting challenges to the research of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Among these challenges are the huge branching factor of play and constrained time for decision.
In this paper we restrict ourselves the management of military troops at a micro-level, that is: given a scenario with for example 10 vs.\ 10 units that have already discovered each other, which actions should our units perform?

\emph{
We describe three different approaches: using scripted behaviors, Alpha-Beta search and UCT search, for unit control in combat scenarios in the game Stacraft: Broodwar, using the Broodwar API (BWAPI) for interfacing with the game \cite{BWAPI}.

\begin{bfseries} Abstract -- \end{bfseries}
\emph{Real Time Strategy games (RTS) present a complete simulated environment that can be used to develop artificial intelligence. They are also known to be very complex for computer agents due to the time limitation of decision.
Our field of study was restricted to the management of military troops: given a units distribution, how shall we play to defeat the opponent. In this paper we explore two differents behaviors: scripted behaviors and heuristic search based for unit control in combat scenarios.}

\emph{Our bot is based on Stacraft: Broodwar and developed using the Broodwar API \cite{BWAPI}.}

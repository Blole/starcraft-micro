\begin{bfseries} Abstract -- \end{bfseries}
\emph{
Real Time Strategy games (RTS) present a complete simulated environment that pose many interesting challenges to the research of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Among these challenges are the huge branching factor of play and constrained time for making decisions.
In this paper we restrict ourselves the management of combat units at a micro-level, that is: given a scenario with for example 10 vs.\ 10 units that are about to engage in battle, which actions should our units perform?
}

\emph{
We present a detailed model for the simulation of such battles, together with two different searching algorithms making use of the model, Alpha-Beta and UCT.
We also describe some scripted behaviors and their implemention in the game Stacraft: Broodwar, using the Broodwar API (BWAPI) for interfacing with the game \cite{BWAPI}.
